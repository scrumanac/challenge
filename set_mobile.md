# Software Engineer in Test (iOS/Android) - Technical Challenge

## Introduction

At Scrumanac, we are rapidly growing and want to ensure our mobile apps are production ready with good test coverage.
You are thus being asked to write automated tests for the provided app in this tech challenge.
The app is developed to meet the following functional requirements:
  - Landing page with list of items to be delivered (with infinity scroll).
  - Long press on an item will delete it.
  - Clicking an item will take you to its item details page.
  - Support for devices running iOS 9/Android 5.0 onwards.

## Deliverables
  - Write tests that cover all the functional requirements.
  - Test report should be generated after a test run on the emulator.
  - Provide instructions for setting up the environment and running the tests.
  - Submit the project as a git repo (github.com, bitbucket.com, gitlab.com). Please avoid words containing scrumanac and challenge if it's a public repo.

## Bonus
  - Write performance tests for app stability.
  - Write tests that cover edge cases.

## Notes
  - You could choose any test framework. (We prefer UI Automator 2.0 for Android or XCUITest (with Swift) for iOS).
  - Choose one platform (iOS/Android) most appropriate for you.
  - Unit tests are out of scope.
