### What we expect from you?

Production ready solution that you are proud of.

  * We only accept GitHub and BitBucket repositories, other Git repo hosting services or ZIP archives are not accepted
* App should cache deliveries (either use local database or local persistent storage)
* Should implement pagination, retrieve up to 20 items per page
* Code should be testable
* Candidates are free to use any libraries

### Cross Platform Engineer

* Must use React Native or Flutter
* Allowing screen rotation is required in Android devices

* Must write in the latest Swift version

### Android Engineer

* Must write in Kotlin

#### Areas we will assess (for Android Engineer only)

1. Architecture, not to include everything inside `Activity` or `Fragment`
2. Use of dependency injection
3. Good code style & formatting
4. Automated test cases (nice to have, no need to make it 100% coverage)
